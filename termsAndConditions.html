      wish to help with the development or translation of the game contact us directly. The
      game itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other

      The game uses the internet to update it's content and to serve ads.
      If you’re playing the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
      that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
      still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
      the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
      app, or other third-party charges. In playing the game, you’re accepting
      responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
      play the game outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
      without turning off data roaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is currently
      available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for the both systems(and
      for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the game
      to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to
      keep using the app. Paulo Correia does not promise that it will always
      update the game so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android
      &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you
      promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you,
      We may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate use of it at
      any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
      otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
      you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop playing the game and (if
      needed) delete it from your device.
